# RECORD-LINKAGE-PART2
This project is about finding the potential match between two excel files based on 3 conditions. The approach used in this project is PySpark for faster computations.

Note:- PySpark use Java in backend so make sure you install 'jre-8u121-windows-x64.exe' in your system. Version may vary accordingly.

Three conditions are as follows:-

1> Based on Names

2> Based on Name and Address

3> Based on Name, Address, City, State, Zipcode and country

The outcome of this script will be a excel file and the result will be saved in different spreadsheet accordingly.

Process to RUN:-

you have to run code.py file but before that please make sure all the files are in the same folder.
